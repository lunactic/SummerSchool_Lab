# Summer School Lab: Structural Methods for Handwriting Analysis

This Repository contains all information for the Lab of Andreas Fischer at the TC10/11 Summer School on Document Analysis and Recognition.

This Lab is organized by [Andreas Fischer](http://diuf.unifr.ch/main/diva/home/people/andreas-fischers-home-page) and [Marcel WÃ¼rsch](http://diuf.unifr.ch/main/diva/home/people/marcel-w%C3%BCrsch)


## Goals

The goals of this Lab is twofold:
 - Interact with methods provided on DIVAServices in order to speed up your work
 - Perform a very basic Key Word Spotting with a structural approach based on graphs

## Data
The ground-truth data is available in the 'data' folder. 
This data is compiled from the following sources:
- [IAM Historical Document Database](http://www.fki.inf.unibe.ch/databases/iam-historical-document-database), for the line segmentation and the transcription
- [http://www.histograph.ch](http://www.histograph.ch), for the word segmentation

You find the following sub-folder in there:
### ground-truth
Contains ground-truth data.

#### transcription.txt
Contains the transcription of all words (on a character level) of the whole dataset. The Format is as follows:

	- XXX-YY-ZZ: XXX = Document Number, YY = Line Number, ZZ = Word Number
	- Contains the character-wise transcription of the word (letters seperated with dashes)
	- Special characters denoted with s_
		- numbers (s_x)
		- punctuation (s_pt, s_cm, ...)
		- strong s (s_s)
		- hyphen (s_mi)
		- semicolon (s_sq)
		- apostrophe (s_qt)
		- colon (s_qo)

#### locations
Contains bounding boxes for all words in the svg-format.

	- XXX.svg: File containing the bounding boxes for the given documents
	- **id** contains the same XXX-YY-ZZ naming as above

### images ###
Contains the original images in jpg-format.

## Tasks

This Lab is split into two bigger tasks with multiple smaller steps. These steps will be explained afterwards: 
- Preprocessing of the data
    - Binarize the original image
    - Cut out the words from the binarized page image
    - Extract word graphs from the word images 
- Spot a keyword
    - Match a keyword GXL gainst all word GXLs
        - Implement Hausdorff Edit Distance
    - Find top-10 matches
        - Display the top-10 images 

### Task 1 - Preprocessing of the data

Preprocessing of the data consists of two steps:
- Binarize the page image
- Cutting out the  words from the binarized page image
- Extracting the word graphs from the word images

These steps will be performed using methods provided on [DIVAServices](https://lunactic.github.io/DIVAServicesweb/), and to get you started you can find parts of the implementation of this in the [process.py](src/task1/process.py) file.

**Complete Binarization**
The method `binarize_page` should binarize the original input image using Otsu-Binarization from DIVAServices.
You can find a Tutorial on how to use methods on DIVAServices [here](https://lunactic.github.io/DIVAServicesweb/articles/first-execution/).

In order to execute the method you need to know the following pieces of information:
- the url of the method is: http://divaservices.unifr.ch/api/v2/binarization/otsubinarization/1
- the method takes no `parameters`
- the method takes the following `inputs`:
   -  `inputImage`: The reference to the image on DIVAServices in the form of `COLLECTION_NAME/FILENAME.EXTENSION`

Hints:
- Use the Tutorial, as well as the other existing methods that execute methods on DIVAServices for guidance.
- `pollResult(...)` can be used to automatically poll DIVAServices until the result is available.

**Complete Extract Words**
The methods `extract_words(...)` and `extract_words_binary(...)` extract the word images from the page. This is performed by cutting out the word images from an svg that provides the bounding boxes as a polygon for each word. Obviously we could perform this step offline, look for the according libraries etc., and do the implementation.

But the simpler way is to use a method that performs this on DIVAServices. So similarly as above complete the two methods using the following information:
- the url of the method is: http://divaservices.unifr.ch/api/v2/kws/wordimageextraction/1
- the method takes no parameters
- the method takes the following `inputs`:
    - `inputImage` : The reference to the binarized image on DIVAServices in the form of `COLLECTION_NAME/FILENAME.EXTENSION`
    - `pathSvg`: The reference to the path svg file on DIVAServices again in the form of `COLLECTION_NAME/FILENAME.EXTENSION`


**Run the preprocessing**
Once you have implemented all these steps, execute the method from the command line using `python src/process.py` from the root-directory of this project.

This will generate you the following outputs:
- `out/XXX/binary_page/`: a folder that contains the binarized page image
- `out/XXX/words_binary/`: a folder containing all binarized word images with the correct naming
- `out/XXX/graphs_binary/`: a folder containing all graph xml files with the correct naming

These can then be used for the second part of this tutorial.


### Task 2 - Comparing Keywords

### Running with Random HED
The basic provided implementation has a Hausdorff-Edit-Distance implementation that returns a random distance.

Test this implementation by changing the following variable in `Main.java`:
- `pathOut`: Full path to the `out` directory from Task 1

And compile and execute the Main file. This should generate you the following outputs:

```
Reading keyword graph and page graphs ...
... done. Read 3727 graphs in 6547.0 ms.

Matching keyword graph with page graphs ...
... done. Matched 3726 graphs in 6.0 ms.

### Computing HED
Obviously the above implementation is not very good, so we want to improve.
In the second task the goal is to compare a target keyword graph with all other graphs.
This should be perform using a Graph Edit Distance (GED) with Hausdorff-Edit-Distance (HED).

In `src/task2/kws` you find Java code that has an implementation to perform the matching on all extracted graph files.
All that is left to you to impement is the function
``` Java
public double match(KGraph g1, KGraph g2) {
}
```
In the file `HED.java`. Everything else is already implemented for you.

### Running recognition
Before compiling the sources make sure to change the two following variables in `Main.java`:
- `pathOut`: Full path to the `out` directory from Task 1
- `keywordId`: The ID of the keyword you want to use as search query

Compile your sources (best is using an IDE such as IntelliJ), or from the command line using
```
javac kws/*.java
```
from the `task2` directory.

And then execute the application using
```
java kws.Main
```
again from the `task2` directory. If everything runs fine on the console you should get logging information as follows:

```
Reading keyword graph and page graphs ...
... done. Read 3727 graphs in 20690.0 ms.

Matching keyword graph with page graphs ...
... done. Matched 3726 graphs in 2492.0 ms.
