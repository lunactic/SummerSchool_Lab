# Summer School Lab: Structural Methods for Handwriting Analysis

This Repository contains all information for the Lab of Andreas Fischer at the TC10/11 Summer School on Document Analysis and Recognition.

This Lab is organized by [Andreas Fischer](http://diuf.unifr.ch/main/diva/home/people/andreas-fischers-home-page) and [Marcel WÃ¼rsch](http://diuf.unifr.ch/main/diva/home/people/marcel-w%C3%BCrsch)


## Goals

The goals of this Lab is twofold:
 - Interact with methods provided on DIVAServices in order to speed up your work
 - Perform a very basic Key Word Spotting with a structural approach based on graphs

## Data
The ground-truth data is available in the 'data' folder. 
This data is compiled from the following sources:
- [IAM Historical Document Database](http://www.fki.inf.unibe.ch/databases/iam-historical-document-database), for the line segmentation and the transcription
- [http://www.histograph.ch](http://www.histograph.ch), for the word segmentation

You find the following sub-folder in there:
### ground-truth
Contains ground-truth data.

#### transcription.txt
Contains the transcription of all words (on a character level) of the whole dataset. The Format is as follows:

	- XXX-YY-ZZ: XXX = Document Number, YY = Line Number, ZZ = Word Number
	- Contains the character-wise transcription of the word (letters seperated with dashes)
	- Special characters denoted with s_
		- numbers (s_x)
		- punctuation (s_pt, s_cm, ...)
		- strong s (s_s)
		- hyphen (s_mi)
		- semicolon (s_sq)
		- apostrophe (s_qt)
		- colon (s_qo)

#### locations
Contains bounding boxes for all words in the svg-format.

	- XXX.svg: File containing the bounding boxes for the given documents
	- **id** contains the same XXX-YY-ZZ naming as above

### images ###
Contains the original images in jpg-format.

## Tasks

This Lab is split into two bigger tasks with multiple smaller steps. These steps will be explained afterwards: 
- Preprocessing of the data
    - Binarize the original image
    - Cut out the words from the binarized page image
    - Extract word graphs from the word images 
- Spot a keyword
    - Match a keyword GXL gainst all word GXLs
        - Implement Hausdorff Edit Distance
    - Find top-10 matches
        - Display the top-10 images 

### Preprocessing of the data

Preprocessing of the data consists of two steps:
- Binarize the page image
- Cutting out the  words from the binarized page image
- Extracting the word graphs from the word images

These steps will be performed using methods provided on [DIVAServices](https://lunactic.github.io/DIVAServicesweb/), and to get you started you can find parts of the implementation of this in the [process.py](src/process.py) file.

**Complete Binarization**
The method `binarize_page` should binarize the original input image using Otsu-Binarization from DIVAServices.
You can find a Tutorial on how to use methods on DIVAServices [here](https://lunactic.github.io/DIVAServicesweb/articles/first-execution/).

In order to execute the method you need to know the following pieces of information:
- the url of the method is: http://divaservices.unifr.ch/api/v2/binarization/otsubinarization/1
- the method takes no `parameters`
- the method takes the following `inputs`:
   -  `inputImage`: The reference to the image on DIVAServices in the form of `COLLECTION_NAME/FILENAME.EXTENSION`

Hints:
- Use the Tutorial, as well as the other existing methods that execute methods on DIVAServices for guidance.
- `pollResult(...)` can be used to automatically poll DIVAServices until the result is available.

**Complete Extract Words**
The methods `extract_words(...)` and `extract_words_binary(...)` extract the word images from the page. This is performed by cutting out the word images from an svg that provides the bounding boxes as a polygon for each word. Obviously we could perform this step offline, look for the according libraries etc., and do the implementation.

But the simpler way is to use a method that performs this on DIVAServices. So similarly as above complete the two methods using the following information:
- the url of the method is: http://divaservices.unifr.ch/api/v2/kws/wordimageextraction/1
- the method takes no parameters
- the method takes the following `inputs`:
    - `inputImage` : The reference to the binarized image on DIVAServices in the form of `COLLECTION_NAME/FILENAME.EXTENSION`
    - `pathSvg`: The reference to the path svg file on DIVAServices again in the form of `COLLECTION_NAME/FILENAME.EXTENSION`


**Run the preprocessing**
Once you have implemented all these steps, execute the method from the command line using `python src/process.py` from the root-directory of this project.

This will generate you the following outputs:
- `out/XXX/binary_page/`: a folder that contains the binarized page image
- `out/XXX/words_binary/`: a folder containing all binarized word images with the correct naming
- `out/XXX/graphs_binary/`: a folder containing all graph xml files with the correct naming

These can then be used for the second part of this tutorial.
